# Predicting-House-Prices-Using-Linear-Regression
Predicting House Prices Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression in Python. The notebook walks through a complete machine learning pipeline starting from problem definition to model deployment.

Project Workflow

Problem Statement – Define the objective of predicting house prices.

Data Collection – Load and inspect the dataset.

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering.

Defining Features & Target – Select independent (X) and dependent (y) variables.

Train-Test Split – Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training – Train a Linear Regression model.

Model Evaluation – Evaluate model performance using metrics such as R² score, MAE, and RMSE.

Model Saving – Save the trained model for future predictions.

Deployment (Optional) – Prepare the model for deployment in real-world applications.
